In PHP, you can display text or data on the screen using either echo or print. Both are language constructs used to output content to the browser, but they have a few differences worth noting.

✅ echo – Most Commonly Used

<?php
echo "Hello, world!";
?>
✅ Faster than print (slightly, in performance)

✅ Can take multiple arguments (though rarely used this way)

❌ Does not return a value

Example with multiple arguments:


echo "Hello, ", "world", "!";
✅ print – Similar to echo, But Slightly Different

<?php
print "Hello, world!";
?>
❌ Slightly slower than echo

❌ Accepts only one argument

✅ Returns a value (1), so it can be used in expressions

Example usage in an expression:


$success = print "Printed successfully!";
📌 Key Differences

Feature	echo	print
Arguments	Multiple (comma-separated)	Only one
Return Value	No	Yes (always returns 1)
Speed	Slightly faster	Slightly slower
Use in expressions	No	Yes
🧪 Example:

<?php
echo "Using echo<br>";
print "Using print<br>";

$value = print "Storing print result<br>"; // Returns 1
echo "Return value of print: " . $value;
?>
💡 Which One Should You Use?
Prefer echo for general output (it's faster and more flexible)

Use print if you specifically need a return value in an expression (rare)
